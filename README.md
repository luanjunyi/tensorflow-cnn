# tensorflow-cnn

This is idea like Keras, but using only Tensorflow as engine. Why not just use Keras? Because I often need to do some hacks deep 
in the stack and need full control. I would cerntainly write CNN in numpy if there's GPU support.

Feel free to comment and have a try on it. Happy training!
